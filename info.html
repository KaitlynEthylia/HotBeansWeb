	<p>Hi! I'm Kaitlyn, a.k.a. Kacy. This website was made as part of a college assignment involving the creation of a
		website for a fictitious web development company called Hot Beans Web. None of the contacts on this website are
		real (though if you feel like paying me money, I'll gladly make a website for you). Nor are any of the claims
		made on this site real (I just found a bunch of good looking websites and claimed the company made them).
		Regardless, If for whatever reason you feel like contacting me, you can find me on Mastodon at
		<a href="https://tech.lgbt/@kaitlynethylia">@kaitlynethylia@tech.lgbt</a>, or via my own website, once that's
		in a finished-enough state for me to be able to link it here.
	</p>
